Vertical Navigation Bar
Image Modals
Responsive Gallery
Section Layout

The left side navigation bar stays fixed as you scroll.

I did a grid layout on the WORK section part using .tall and .wide depending on their orientation and size so the pictures would set nicely. When you click on a picture in the WORK gallery, it pops up big in the center of the screen with a dark background.
